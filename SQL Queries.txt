SQL Queries

1. Report out all the requirements for the major in a fashion that is easily readable.
SELECT DISTINCT majors.name, requirements.name, requirements.description
FROM requirements INNER JOIN majors on majors.name = requirements.majorname
ORDER BY majors.name, requirements.name;

2. For each course, find all the requirements that it could be used in.
SELECT courserequirements.coursename, courserequirements.requirementname
FROM courserequirements
ORDER BY courserequirement.coursename;


3. List all the Upper Division courses in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT courses.abrev ||': '|| courses.name AS "UPPER DIVISION"
FROM courses
WHERE courses.number >= 300
ORDER BY "UPPER DIVISION";


4. List all the focus areas, one line each, with a list of the courses in that focus area. ListAgg in SQL will be a help here.
SELECT courserequrirements.requirementname, LISTAGG(courserequrirements.coursename AS "COURSE", ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY courserequrirements.requirementname)
FROM courserequirements
WHERE courserequrirements.requirementname LIKE '%elective%'
GROUP BY courserequrirements.name
ORDER BY courserequrirements.name;


5. For each department that contributes a course to the CECS computer science degree, list all the courses in that department.
WITH cecsdepartments AS (SELECT DISTINCT departments.name AS "CECS Collaboration"
  FROM departments INNER JOIN courses on departments.name = courses.departmentname
  INNER JOIN courserequirements USING (coursename)
  WHERE courserequirements.requirementname LIKE "%Bachelor's%"
)
SELECT "CECS Collaboration", courses.abrev || ' ' || courses.number || ': '|| courses.name AS "COURSE"
FROM cecsdepartments INNER JOIN courses on department.name = courses.departmentname
ORDER BY "CECS Collaboration", "COURSE"
