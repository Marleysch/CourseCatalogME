SQL Queries
# Effectively completed
1. Report out all the requirements for the major in a fashion that is easily readable.
SELECT DISTINCT major.name, requirement.name, requirement.description
FROM requirements INNER JOIN majors on major.name = requirements.majorname
ORDER BY major.name, requirement.name;

# USE the fullfillment class to get all the propermatches of courses to requirements
2. For each course, find all the requirements that it could be used in.
SELECT course.name, requirement.name
FROM courses CROSS JOIN requirements
WHERE courses NOT IN (SELECT course.name
ORDER BY course.name;

# Adjust for alphabetical order
3. List all the Upper Division courses in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT course.abrev || ' ' || course.number || ': '|| course.name AS "UPPER DIVISION"
FROM courses
WHERE course.number >= 300
ORDER BY "UPPER DIVISION";

# Syntax has issues, LISTAGG needs research
4. List all the focus areas, one line each, with a list of the courses in that focus area. ListAgg in SQL will be a help here.
SELECT requrirement.name, LISTAGG(course.abrev || ' ' || course.number || ': '|| course.name AS "COURSE", ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY course.number)
FROM courserequirements
WHERE requirements.name LIKE '%ELECTIVE%'
GROUP BY requirement.name
ORDER BY requirement.name;

# Confusing wording, needs clarification; Start by finding the departments needed to fullfill a major, getting all the courses from the dept is easy
5. For each department that contributes a course to the CECS computer science degree, list all the courses in that department.
WITH cecsdepartments AS (SELECT DISTINCT department.name AS "CECS Collaboration"
  FROM departments INNER JOIN courses on department.name = courses.departmentname
  INNER JOIN coursefulfillment USING (coursename)
  WHERE coursefulfillment.requirementname LIKE "%computer science%"
)
SELECT "CECS Collaboration", course.abrev || ' ' || course.number || ': '|| course.name AS "COURSE"
FROM cecsdepartments INNER JOIN courses on department.name
ORDER BY "CECS Collaboration", "COURSE"
